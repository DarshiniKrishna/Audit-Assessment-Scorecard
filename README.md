# Pre-Assessment-Scorecard
This scorecard helps auditors identify and evaluate red flags in financial statements during client acceptance by scoring and normalizing 50 predefined red flags based on impact, likelihood, historical occurrence, and magnitude. This tool enables auditors to prioritize risks effectively, ensuring a thorough and objective assessment of potential issues. By identifying significant risks early, auditors can make informed decisions on whether to accept a client, enhancing the quality of the client acceptance process and mitigating potential problems before engagement.

# Post-Assessment-Scorecard
This scorecard evaluates the completeness and sufficiency of audit reports by checking the inclusion and quality of required elements as per auditing standards (SSA and ISA). Each element is assessed for its presence and compliance, scored accordingly, and the total score is calculated as a percentage. The score is then categorized into ranges (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor) to indicate the overall quality of the audit report. This systematic approach ensures auditors can identify and address any deficiencies, enhancing the report's reliability and transparency.
